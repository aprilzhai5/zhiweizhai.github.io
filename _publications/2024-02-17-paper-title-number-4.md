Rapid advances in low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite technology and satellite edge computing (SEC) have facilitated a key role for LEO satellites in enhanced Earth observation missions (EOM). These missions (e.g., remote object detection) typically require multi-satellite cooperative observations of a large region of interest (RoI) area, as well as the observation image routing and computation processing, enabling accurate and real-time responsiveness. However, optimizing the resources of LEO satellite networks is nontrivial in the presence of its dynamic and heterogeneous properties. To this end, we propose SECO, a SEC-enabled framework that jointly optimizes multi-satellite observation scheduling, routing and computation node selection for enhanced EOM. Specifically, in the observation phase, we leverage the orbital motion and the rotatable onboard cameras of satellites, and propose a distributed game-based scheduling strategy to minimize the overall size of captured images while ensuring full (observation) coverage. In the sequent routing and computation phase, we first adopt image splitting technology to achieve parallel transmission and computation. Then, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm to jointly optimize image splitting, routing and computation node selection for each captured image. On this basis, we propose a theoretically guaranteed systemwide greedy-based strategy to reduce the total time cost (i.e., transmission, computation and queuing delay) over simultaneous processing for multiple images. Extensive experiments based on real-world datasets demonstrate that SECO can achieve up to a 60.7% reduction in overall time cost compared to baselines.
